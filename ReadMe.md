# Teachers: Romina Henriques & Belen Jimenez-Mena

Wednesday 09/10/2019
 - 8am - 10pm: Introduction to population genetics (theory + practical)
 - 10am - 12: Population genetics' tools for conservation and management (theory + practical)

## Material

Slides can be found here: (https://github.com/belenjm/).

The data for practicals has been already downloaded and it is provided in '/home/EXERCICES/lecture6'.
These instructions, including all relevant files and scripts, can be found at '/home/EXERCISES/lecture6'.
In short, you don't have to worry about anything for the practicals.

### Data

As an illustration, we will use a VCF file from the flat oyster, published in a recent article: Detailed insights into pan-European population structure and inbreeding in wild and hatchery Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) populations revealed by genome-wide SNP data.
We extracted the PED files from the article's repository (https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6d778b6.), and transformed it into a VCF file.
The oyster data represents a SNP-chip from variation all over the genome.

## Preparation

We'll be making some exercises on this dataset to study how we can give some insights for conservation/management of this population.
However, before doing anything else, please create a folder where you will put all the results and some temporary data.
```
mkdir Results
mkdir Data
```
That's it.
